# AirBnB Clone Backend

## 🚀 Overview
The **AirBnB Clone Backend** project is a server-side system that replicates the core functionality of Airbnb — from user management and property listings to bookings, payments, and reviews.  
This project aims to build a **scalable, modular, and well-documented backend architecture** that can serve as both a learning foundation and a deployable application.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- **User Management**: Secure registration, authentication, and profile updates.  
- **Property Management**: Create, read, update, and delete property listings.  
- **Booking System**: Handle reservations, availability, and booking modifications.  
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate a basic payment workflow (Stripe for MVP).  
- **Review System**: Enable users to leave reviews and ratings.  
- **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient querying and caching.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Framework | Django REST Framework | Core backend APIs (CRUD, authentication) |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Relational data storage |
| Task Queue | Celery + Redis | Asynchronous tasks and caching |
| API Interface | REST + (optional) GraphQL | Data access and flexibility |
| Deployment | Docker + CI/CD | Environment consistency and automation |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub | Collaboration and tracking |

| **Django**                      | A high-level Python web framework that provides a robust foundation for building the backend, handling routing, models, and business logic.       |
| **Django REST Framework (DRF)** | Extends Django to create RESTful APIs easily, handling serialization, authentication, and request/response management.                            |
| **GraphQL**                     | Provides a flexible and efficient query interface for clients to request only the data they need, complementing REST APIs.                        |
| **PostgreSQL**                  | Relational database for storing structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and reviews. Supports indexing and optimized queries.        |
| **Celery**                      | Task queue for executing asynchronous jobs, such as sending emails, processing payments, or handling background tasks.                            |
| **Redis**                       | In-memory database used for caching frequently accessed data and for managing Celery task queues. Improves performance and reduces database load. |
| **Docker**                      | Containerization platform that ensures the application runs consistently across different environments (development, staging, production).        |
| **CI/CD Pipelines**             | Automates testing and deployment, ensuring that changes to the backend are safely integrated and deployed.                                        |
