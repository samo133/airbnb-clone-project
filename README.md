# AirBnB Clone Backend

## üöÄ Overview
The **AirBnB Clone Backend** project is a server-side system that replicates the core functionality of Airbnb ‚Äî from user management and property listings to bookings, payments, and reviews.  
This project aims to build a **scalable, modular, and well-documented backend architecture** that can serve as both a learning foundation and a deployable application.

## üéØ Project Goals
- **User Management**: Secure registration, authentication, and profile updates.  
- **Property Management**: Create, read, update, and delete property listings.  
- **Booking System**: Handle reservations, availability, and booking modifications.  
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate a basic payment workflow (Stripe for MVP).  
- **Review System**: Enable users to leave reviews and ratings.  
- **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient querying and caching.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Framework | Django REST Framework | Core backend APIs (CRUD, authentication) |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Relational data storage |
| Task Queue | Celery + Redis | Asynchronous tasks and caching |
| API Interface | REST + (optional) GraphQL | Data access and flexibility |
| Deployment | Docker + CI/CD | Environment consistency and automation |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub | Collaboration and tracking |
